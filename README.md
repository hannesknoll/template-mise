# mise Template

This template is used to bootstrap projects with mise.

It includes:
- **git-cliff** to generate CHANGELOG.md
- **committed** to enforce commit standards
- **gitleaks** to detect secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in the repo
- **lefthook** to manage git hooks
- **mise tasks** which can be written as normal shell scripts in `.config/mise/tasks`
